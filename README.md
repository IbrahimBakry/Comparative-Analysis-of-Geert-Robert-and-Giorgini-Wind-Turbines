# Comparative-Analysis-of-Geert-Robert-and-Giorgini-Wind-Turbines
This study compares three Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) designs—Geert, Robert, and Giorgini—to determine the most aerodynamically efficient model. Using CFD simulations, key performance metrics such as pressure distribution, airflow velocity, and rotational moment (Cm) were analyzed.
